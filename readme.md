# EvangelicalMagazinePlugin
Custom WordPress plugin for the [Evangelical Magazine website](https://www.evangelicalmagazine.com/). Provided here as a help to other developers who are creating WordPress sites for print magazines. This plugin adds Custom Post Types for articles, authors, issues, sections and series, plus a handful of useful widgets. It's compatible with the [Instant Articles for WP](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/fb-instant-articles/) plugin, and is designed to be used in conjunction with the [EvangelicalMagazineTheme](https://github.com/markbarnes/EvangelicalMagazineTheme).

## Support
No support is offered for this plugin. It was not created with distribution in mind, has no user-configurable options and although it may work out of the box in another context (so long as you edit classes/fb_access_tokens_sample.php), it's intended to be forked. It's published here purely as a help to other developers (particularly those working for non-profits) who need something similar and want to minimize development time.
